# Deploying the Dialect Analysis Visualization

How the Streamlit visualization is hosted on the ZHAW-internal server and how to maintain it. The deployment lives at
`/opt/dialect-analysis` and runs under a dedicated service account, `dialectanalysis`.

## What it is

A Streamlit web app (`visualization/Home.py` plus two pages) for exploring dialect-specific words.
It compares the two ASR transcripts (DAT and DIT) against the Standard German reference, for the
STT4SG-350 and SDS-200 corpora. It reads precomputed word-alignment parquets and transcript TSVs.
Nothing is computed from audio at runtime.

## How it works

- One long-running Streamlit process (Python, serves HTTP and uses WebSockets for live updates).
- Runs under the **`dialectanalysis`** service account (no login shell), which also owns the files.
- A systemd service named `streamlit` runs it: restarts on crash (`Restart=always`) and starts on
  boot (`enable`).
- Plain HTTP on port 80. Reachable at `http://<server-hostname>` from the ZHAW
  network or VPN (`hostname -f` prints the address). The unit grants `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` so it
  binds port 80 without running as root.
- A single shared password gates **audio playback** (anti-crawl for the licensed corpora).
- Dependencies live in a uv virtualenv at `/opt/dialect-analysis/.venv`.

## Server layout

Everything is under `/opt/dialect-analysis`, owned by `dialectanalysis`.

| What | Path (under /opt/dialect-analysis) | In git? |
|---|---|---|
| App code | `visualization/` | yes |
| Alignment parquets | `experiments/analysis/{stt4sg,sds-200}/*.parquet` | yes |
| Transcript TSVs | `transcripts/**`, `datasets/STT4SG-350 v2.1/train_balanced.tsv` | yes |
| Audio clips (~41 GB) | `datasets/STT4SG-350 v2.1/clips__*`, `datasets/SDS-200 Corpus/export_20211220_clips-001` | no |
| Python env (uv) | `.venv` | no |
| Password | `.streamlit/secrets.toml` | no |

The audio and password are not in git; they live only on the server.

## Operations

The repo is owned by `dialectanalysis`, so run git as that account; `systemctl` needs `sudo`.
A handy shell alias: `alias dgit='sudo -u dialectanalysis -H git -C /opt/dialect-analysis'`.

Deploy an update (the common case):
```bash
sudo -u dialectanalysis -H git -C /opt/dialect-analysis pull # or `dgit pull` if alias activated
sudo -u dialectanalysis -H sh -c 'cd /opt/dialect-analysis && uv pip install -r requirements.txt' # only if Python dependencies changed
sudo systemctl restart streamlit
systemctl status streamlit          # expect: active (running)
```

Service control and inspection:
```bash
systemctl status streamlit          # running?
sudo systemctl restart streamlit    # apply changes
sudo systemctl stop streamlit       # take offline
sudo systemctl start streamlit      # bring back
journalctl -u streamlit -e          # recent logs (errors here)
journalctl -u streamlit -f          # follow live
```

Change the password:
```bash
printf 'password = "<new-password>"\n' | sudo -u dialectanalysis tee /opt/dialect-analysis/.streamlit/secrets.toml >/dev/null
sudo chmod 600 /opt/dialect-analysis/.streamlit/secrets.toml
sudo systemctl restart streamlit
```

## First-time setup or rebuild

Only needed on a new server or after a wipe.

1. Service account:
   ```bash
   sudo useradd --system --home-dir /opt/dialect-analysis --shell /usr/sbin/nologin dialectanalysis
   ```
2. Code (public repo, clone over HTTPS for the initial read, then hand it to the account):
   ```bash
   sudo git clone https://github.com/michamettler/BA-FS26_ciel_Mettler_Dialektanalyse.git /opt/dialect-analysis
   sudo chown -R dialectanalysis:dialectanalysis /opt/dialect-analysis
   ```
3. Audio: the corpora are not in git. Stage them under `/opt/dialect-analysis/datasets/` following the
   layout in the parent README's [Datasets](../README.md#datasets) section.
4. Python env (make `uv` available system-wide first if needed, e.g. `sudo cp "$(command -v uv)" /usr/local/bin/uv`):
   ```bash
   sudo -u dialectanalysis -H sh -c 'cd /opt/dialect-analysis && uv venv && uv pip install -r requirements.txt'
   ```
5. Password:
   ```bash
   printf 'password = "<pick>"\n' | sudo -u dialectanalysis tee /opt/dialect-analysis/.streamlit/secrets.toml >/dev/null
   sudo chmod 600 /opt/dialect-analysis/.streamlit/secrets.toml
   ```
6. Service:
   ```bash
   sudo cp /opt/dialect-analysis/deploy/streamlit.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now streamlit
   ```
7. Firewall: open 80 to the internal subnet with `sudo ufw allow 80/tcp` (firewalld:
   `sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=80/tcp --permanent && sudo firewall-cmd --reload`).
8. Check: `curl -sI http://localhost` returns `HTTP/1.1 200`, then open `http://<server-hostname>` in
   a browser and the app loads (audio playback prompts for the password; the rest is open).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
|---|---|
| Service won't start (`status` = failed) | `journalctl -u streamlit -e`. Usually a wrong path in the unit, a bind error on port 80 (check `sudo ss -ltnp` for another listener), or a missing venv (rebuild step 4). |
| Audio won't unlock ("no password is configured" at the audio prompt) | `/opt/dialect-analysis/.streamlit/secrets.toml` is missing or has no `password`. Only audio is gated — the app itself still loads. Set the password and restart. |
| Browser stuck on "connecting" or reconnect loop | The process was killed (often out of memory) and restarted. Look for `oom` in `journalctl -u streamlit -e` and check `free -h`. |
| "Audio file not found locally" on a clip | That corpus's audio isn't staged at the expected `datasets/...` path. |
| `git pull` says "dubious ownership" | Git was run as the wrong user. Run it as the owner: `sudo -u dialectanalysis -H git -C /opt/dialect-analysis pull`. |
| Slow on the first open after a restart | Expected. The first visit warms an in-memory cache (data load and TF-IDF); later interactions are fast. |
